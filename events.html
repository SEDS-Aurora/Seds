					<time>Inauguration of SEDS-VIT chapter - 07-12-2019</time>
					<p>
						Everything has a beginning, and our inception was on the 7th of December 2019, where we
						established ourselves as the SEDS-chapter here at VIT-AP. SEDS is affiliated with SEDS India,
						headquartered at VIT-VELLORE. The faculty coordinator, President, Vice-President, and Projects
						Head of SEDS-INDIA served as Chief Guests. The Chief Guest, along with our dignitaries
						inaugurated the club. The chief guests along with our faculty coordinator Dr. Sudhagar Jothi

					<time>Black Holes - 25-01-2020</time>
					<p>
						The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not
						the eternal prisons they were once though…things can get out of a black hole both on the outside
						and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up -
						there's a way out.” ― Stephen Hawking What happens when you fall into a black hole? Is it
						possible to pull something out of a Blackhole? and many more such questions were answered in the
						event, which we hosted on our campus on 25-01-2020. The crux of the event was the reality of
						black holes, formation, event horizon, singularity, and the types of black holes.</p>

					<time>A Guest Lecture on Computational Solar Physics - 21-11-2020</time>
					<p>Everyone is part of a connected cosmic system. Part earth and sea, wind and fire, with some salt
						and dust swimming in them. We have a universe within ourselves that mimics the universe
						outside."" The lecture by Dr. Piyali Chatterjee provided new insights and augmented our evolving
						understanding of solar eruptive events. Aurora graphs, Solar base, Research work in IIA, Indian
						missions going on and future, Coronal holes, Solar flares and all the other solar phenomenal
						events were discussed about. The event was conducted in collaboration with OSC-VITAP on the 21st
						of November, 2020.</p>

						favour human settlement on the Moon and Mars were discussed and the topic was further dissected
						to arrive at a reasonable conclusion wrt the future of human space colonization . Furthermore, a
						few interesting facts were presented- An analysis was conducted on the recent 'Monolith Mystery'

					<p>This is the first event of the club for the academic year
						and we came up with an amazing idea which include
						both space and fun activity which many of them like that
						is “Photography” and we both combined them and we
						had created wonders where everyone can enjoy and we
						had taken them in an amazing ride where they had seen
						the beauty of sky and stars and constellations and they
						all had enjoyed it a lot and had given active participation
						and with the hands-on experience we had created
						wonders like never before and at final we can say that
						the event had become successful

					<p>After Completion of first event successfully we had
						planned the second event a lot more interesting than the
						first one along with the collaboration with Spaceonova
						we had created a workshop with the help of python
						which nowadays is playing a huge role in the software
						industry and using that many of the new space
						technologies are being invented so in this Hands on
						workshop we are going to see how the python is being
						used in the space technology and what are the wonders
						we can create using python in space technology where
						the possibilities are limitless and the space is yours in
						the two days workshop we had so much fun and we had
						learnt a lot about the usage of python in Space
						Technology

						Vanguard - 11-04-22
					</time>
					<p>
						This event got people acquainted with Voyager-1 and 2,
						the satellites that have exceeded human
						expectations and travelled to the most outer reaches of
						our solar system, like the Voyager-1 has crossed
						our full solar system!
						Next, get caught up with an innovative company called
						Starlink that is doing amazing things in areas of
						providing high speed internet to even the most remote
						regions of the world.
						Then, we talked about our one of the most favorite space
						instruments, i.e.- a telescope, and not just
						any normal telescope, but space telescopes namely
						Hubble and James Webb.
						Next, the very interesting and mysterious exoplanets
						were introduced.
						And, at last we tell all about Solar Flares, a space
						phenomenon that is beautiful and harmful.
